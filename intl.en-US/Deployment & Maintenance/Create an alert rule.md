# Create an alert rule

This topic describes how to create alert rules to monitor the usage and status of NAT gateways in real time. This ensures the stability of your workloads.

If you delete a NAT gateway, the alert rules for the NAT gateway are also deleted from Cloud Monitor.

1.  Log on to the [NAT Gateway console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/nat).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the NAT gateway is created.

3.  On the NAT Gateway page, find the NAT gateway that you want to manage, and click the ![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6894140061/p41324.png) icon in the **Monitoring** column.

4.  On the **Monitoring Information** page, click **Alert Threshold Settings**.

5.  Click **Create Alert Rule**.

6.  On the **Create Alert Rule** page, specify the related resources, alert rules, and notification methods, and click **Confirm**.
