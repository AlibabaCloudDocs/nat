# Create a NAT Gateway {#task_491107 .task}

This topic describes how to create a NAT Gateway. You must create a NAT Gateway before configuring SNAT and DNAT entries.

A VPC and a VSwitch are created. For more information, see [Create a VPC and a VSwitch](../intl.en-US/User Guide/VPC and subnets/Manage a VPC.md#section_ufw_rhv_rdb).

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com/nat/).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **NAT Gateways**.
3.   On the NAT Gateways page, click **Create NAT Gateway**. 
4.   Configure the NAT Gateway according to the following information and complete the payment. 

    |Configuration|Description|
    |:------------|:----------|
    | **Region** |Select the region where the VPC to which the NAT Gateway belongs is located.|
    | **VPC ID** |Select the VPC for which the NAT Gateway is created. After the NAT Gateway is created, you cannot change the VPC. **Note:** If you cannot find the target VPC in the VPC list, troubleshoot as follows:

    -   Check whether the VPC already has a NAT Gateway configured. A VPC can be configured with only one NAT Gateway.
    -   Check whether a custom route entry, whose destination CIDR block is 0.0.0.0/0, already exists in the VPC.Â  If so, delete this custom route entry.
 |
    | **Specification** |Select a specification for the NAT Gateway. Different specifications correspond to different Max Connections and Connections Per Second \(CPS\) of the SNAT function, however, the data throughput is not affected. **Note:** The specification does not limit the number of connections and throughput of the DNAT function. For more information, see [Specifications of NAT Gateway](../intl.en-US/User Guide/Specifications of NAT Gateway.md#).

    | **Billing cycle** |Select a billing cycle for the NAT Gateway.|
