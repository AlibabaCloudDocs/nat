# Use Cloud Monitor to monitor NAT gateways

This topic describes how to use Cloud Monitor to monitor NAT gateways. You can use Cloud Monitor to monitor NAT gateways and collect monitoring data of NAT gateways in near real time. In the NAT Gateway console, you can troubleshoot issues that occur on your NAT gateways based on the time sequence curves that are generated by Cloud Monitor.

## View monitoring data

1.  Log on to the [NAT Gateway console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/nat).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the NAT gateway is deployed.

3.  On the **NAT Gateway** page, find the NAT gateway that you want to manage and click ![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6894140061/p41324.png) in the **Monitoring** column.

    The monitoring metrics vary based on the types of NAT gateways.

    |Metric category|Metric|Description|
    |---------------|------|-----------|
    |SNAT session statistics|Concurrent connections|The maximum number of concurrent TCP or UDP connections that are supported by a NAT gateway.|
    |Dropped connections|The number of connections dropped due to the limit on the concurrent connections to a NAT gateway.|
    |Rate of new connections|The maximum number of TCP or UDP connections to a NAT gateway per second.|
    |Dropped new connections|The number of new connections dropped due to the limit on the rate of new connections to a NAT gateway.|
    |Ratio of concurrent connections to the upper limit|The ratio of established connections to the upper limit of connections.|
    |Ratio of new connections to the upper limit|The ratio of established new connections to the upper limit of new connections.|
    |Inbound traffic statistics|Inbound traffic rate|The amount of inbound traffic per second:    -   Rate of traffic from the Internet.
    -   Rate of traffic to a VPC. |
    |Inbound traffic|The total amount of inbound traffic:    -   Traffic from the Internet.
    -   Traffic to a VPC. |
    |Inbound packet rate|The number of inbound packets per second:    -   Rate of packets from the Internet.
    -   Rate of packets to a VPC. |
    |Inbound packets|The total number of inbound packets:    -   Packets from the Internet.
    -   Packets to a VPC. |
    |Outbound traffic statistics|Outbound traffic rate|The amount of outbound traffic per second:    -   Rate of traffic to the Internet.
    -   Rate of traffic from a VPC. |
    |Outbound traffic|The total amount of outbound traffic:    -   Traffic to the Internet.
    -   Traffic from a VPC. |
    |Outbound packet rate|The number of outbound packets per second:    -   Rate of packets to the Internet.
    -   Rate of packets from a VPC. |
    |Outbound packets|The number of outbound packets:    -   Packets to the Internet.
    -   Packets from a VPC. |

    |Metric|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |SNAT connections|The number of SNAT connections to the NAT gateway per minute.|
    |Connections dropped due to capacity limits|The size of a NAT gateway determines the maximum number of SNAT connections supported by the NAT gateway. This metric displays the number of SNAT connections that are dropped when the maximum number of SNAT connections is exceeded. **Note:** This metric is a cumulative metric and the collected statistics cannot be cleared.

    -   If the value of this metric continues to increase for a period of time, we recommend that you upgrade your NAT gateway.
    -   If the value of this metric remains unchanged for a period of time, the maximum number of SNAT connections is not exceeded. Therefore, no SNAT connection is dropped. |
    |Connections dropped due to rate limits|The size of a NAT gateway determines the maximum number of new SNAT connections that can be established to the NAT gateway per second. This metric displays the number of new SNAT connections that are dropped when the maximum number of new SNAT connections per second is exceeded. **Note:** This metric is a cumulative metric and the collected statistics cannot be cleared.

    -   If the value of this metric continues to increase for a period of time, we recommend that you upgrade your NAT gateway.
    -   If the value of this metric remains unchanged for a period of time, the maximum number of new SNAT connections per second is not exceeded. Therefore, no new SNAT connection is dropped. |


## View the monitoring data of EIPs that are associated with NAT gateways

1.  Log on to the [NAT Gateway console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/nat).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the NAT gateway is deployed.

3.  On the **NAT Gateway** page, find the NAT gateway that you want to manage and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.

4.  Click the **Monitoring** tab.

5.  Click the **Associated EIP** tab to view the monitoring metrics.

    |Metric|Description|
    |------|-----------|
    |Inbound bandwidth|The bandwidth for traffic from the Internet to an ECS instance. Unit: bit/s.|
    |Outbound bandwidth|The bandwidth for traffic from an ECS instance to the Internet. Unit: bit/s.|
    |Inbound packet rate|The number of packets sent from the Internet to an ECS instance per second.|
    |Outbound packet rate|The number of packets sent from an ECS instance to the Internet per second.|
    |Packet loss rate due to rate limits|Ratio of packets discarded due to the limit on the per-second packet rate.|
    |Inbound bandwidth usage|The bandwidth usage of inbound traffic from the Internet to an ECS instance.|
    |Outbound bandwidth usage|The bandwidth usage of outbound traffic from an ECS instance to the Internet.|
