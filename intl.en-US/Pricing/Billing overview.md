# Billing overview

You are charged when you use NAT gateways. This topic describes the billing methods and billable items of NAT gateways.

## Billing methods

NAT gateways support the pay-as-you-go billing method, which requires you to pay for the resources that you use. If you want to create or delete NAT gateways based on your business requirements, you can purchase pay-as-you-go NAT gateways instead of subscription NAT gateways. For more information, see [Pay-by-data-transfer](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

## Billing details

When a NAT gateway has an overdue payment, you must top up your account and complete the overdue payment before you can continue to use the NAT Gateway service. To top up your account, log on to the Alibaba Cloud Management Console. For more information, see [Overdue payments](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md) and [Recharge your account](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

## Billing of related services

After you create a NAT gateway, you must associate an elastic IP address \(EIP\) with the NAT gateway. This way, the NAT gateway can access the Internet. You are charged for the EIPs that are associated with NAT gateways. For more information, see [Subscription](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md) and [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Pay-as-you-go.md).

If an EIP is associated with an EIP bandwidth plan, the predefined billing method of the EIP becomes invalid. You are charged an Internet data transfer fee for the NAT gateway with which the EIP is associated based on the billing method of the EIP bandwidth plan. For more information, see [Billing](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing.md).

**Note:** If you purchased NAT service plans before January 26, 2018, you can associate public IP addresses in the NAT service plan with the NAT gateway to provide Internet access services. You are charged for NAT gateways and NAT service plans that are associated with the NAT gateways.For more information, see [Billing of NAT service plans](/intl.en-US/Bandwidth Package (Archive)/Billing of NAT service plans.md).
