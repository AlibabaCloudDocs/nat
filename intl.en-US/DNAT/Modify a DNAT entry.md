1.  Log on to the [NAT Gateway console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/nat).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where the NAT gateway is created.

3.  On the **NAT Gateways** page, find the target NAT gateway, and click **Configure DNAT** in the **Actions** column.

4.  In the **DNAT Entry List** section, find the DNAT entry that you want to manage, and click **Edit** in the **Actions** column.

5.  In the **Edit DNAT Entry** dialog box, change the EIP, the private IP address, ports, and the name of the DNAT entry, and then click **OK**.
