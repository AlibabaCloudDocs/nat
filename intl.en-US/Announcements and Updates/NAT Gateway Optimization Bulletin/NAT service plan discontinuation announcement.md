# NAT service plan discontinuation announcement

Valued Alibaba Cloud NAT service plan users:

Beginning from January 26, 2018, NAT Gateway allows you to manage NAT gateways together with EIP bandwidth plans. Alibaba Cloud discontinues NAT service plans on May 15, 2020. We apologize for any inconvenience that may be caused.

After NAT service plans are discontinued, you can continue to use NAT gateways in the following ways:

-   If you have already purchased NAT service plans, you can convert them to EIP bandwidth plans. For more information, see [Convert a NAT service plan to an EIP bandwidth plan](/intl.en-US/Bandwidth Package (Archive)/Convert a NAT service plan to an EIP bandwidth plan.md).

    **Note:** You can continue to use your purchased NAT service plans if you do not want to convert them to EIP bandwidth plans. However, you cannot purchase new NAT service plans.

-   If you want to associate new elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) with your NAT gateways, perform the following steps:
    1.  [Apply for new EIPs](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Create an EIP/Apply for new EIPs.md)
    2.  [Associate an EIP with an EIP bandwidth plan](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Manage Pay-As-You-Go-billed EIPs/Associate an EIP with an EIP bandwidth plan.md)
    3.  [Associate an EIP with a NAT gateway](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Create NAT gateways.md)
    4.  [Create a DNAT entry to provide Internet-facing services](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Create a DNAT entry to provide Internet-facing services.md) or [Create a SNAT entry to access the Internet](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Create a SNAT entry to access the Internet.md)
