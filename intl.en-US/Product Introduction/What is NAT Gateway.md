As an Internet gateway, public IP addresses are required to make NAT Gateway fucntion normally. After creating a NAT Gateway, you can bind an Elastic IP Address \(EIP\) to the NAT Gateway.

**Note:** If your account has purchased a NAT bandwidth package before January 26, 2018, you still need to use the bandwidth package to provide public IPs. To bind an EIP to the NAT Gateway, open a ticket.
