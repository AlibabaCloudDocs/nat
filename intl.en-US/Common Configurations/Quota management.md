# Quota management

This topic describes how to manage the quota usage of NAT gateways in the Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) console. You can request a quota increase if the remaining resources cannot meet the business requirements.

1.  Log on to the [VPC console](https://vpcnext.console.aliyun.com/vpc).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quota Management**.

3.  On the Quota Management page, click the **NAT Gateway** tab to view the quota usage under the account.

4.  To request a quota increase, click **Submit Application** in the **Actions** column.

5.  In the **Submit Quota Application** dialog box, set the following parameters.

    -   **Quantity for Application**: Select the amount of quota that you want to request.
    -   **Reason for Application**: Describe the reasons for the application, including the scenarios and necessity.
    -   **Email**: Enter the email address of the applicant.
6.  Click **OK**.

    The system automatically reviews your quota increase application. You can check whether your application is approved based on the status of the application: If the status displays **Rejected**, your application is rejected. If the status displays **Approved**, your application is approved, and the quota is automatically raised to the specified amount.
